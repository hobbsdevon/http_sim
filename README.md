# http_sim
This is a program written by myself and Brodie McCuen as an assignment for computer networks class. This program partially simulates http using python sockets.

## How to use
To use this program, you must first run the server application. You then input the ip address of the machine that the server is running on, and edit the 'SERVER_IP' global variable in the client side program. You may then run the client program, and follow the prompts being printed to the terminal.
